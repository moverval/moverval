## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

#### I am a hobby developer and a student

- I love math, especially linear algebra for AI, shader programming but also cryptology stuff
- âš¡ Fun fact: Im programming 5 1/2 Years now and the first language I've learned was Java

I mostly use this account to write stuff I love. This is not a working account so I do whatever I want here!
